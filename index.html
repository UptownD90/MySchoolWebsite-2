            North Gwinnett Middle School was established in 1958.[6] It was built in a former cotton field between the communities of Suwanee and Sugar Hill for the purpose of consolidating the two communities' separate middle schools, Suwanee Middle School and Sugar Hill Middle School. The land for the school was donated by the estate of Tom Robinson, for whom the NGMS football field is named.[7]

In its early years, NGMS was a small school. In 1960, the school served grades 6 through 8 and there were 328 students enrolled.[7] The eighth grade was eliminated after a new middle school was built during the 1973-1974 school year. By that year, NGMS had 606 students. The school grew dramatically in subsequent decades. Enrollment reached 1,000 for the first time in the 1988-1989 school year and has reached over 2,800.[7] For the 2011-2012 school year, enrollment was 2,670.[8] As of 2018-2019, enrollment is reported as 2,846 students.

North Gwinnett Middle School figured in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (503 US 60 - Supreme Court 1992), a U.S. Supreme Court case that was decided in 1992. A female student at the school accused a teacher of sexual harassment and sued the school district for monetary damages for not stopping the harassment after she complained to school authorities. The federal district court ruled that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, under which she sued, did not allow for monetary damages. The appeals court affirmed that ruling, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Supreme Court found that Title IX does allow for monetary damages, thus returning the student's case to lower courts.[9][10]
